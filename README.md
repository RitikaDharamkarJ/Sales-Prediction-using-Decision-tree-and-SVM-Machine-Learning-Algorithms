In todayâ€™s data-driven world, fashion retail sales forecasting allows retailers to make informed choices in their business operations such as inventory management, planning and budgeting, and Supply Chain Management. Forecasting a fashion retail sales demand involves predicting the future need for a product or service which is vital for companies to make informed decisions [4]. Traditionally, sales forecasting was done using statistical techniques such as Simple Linear Regression, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving averages (ARIMA), and so on [1, 2]. Machine learning (ML) has recently become a preferred tool in demand and fashion sales forecasting due to improved accuracy, reduced effort, and adaptive nature. Using ML algorithms, we can identify intricate patterns in sales dynamics.  Although new ML algorithms are coming up every day, in the literature survey conducted, it was found that the two competent algorithms to predict Fashion retail sales forecasting are Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT). We analyse and evaluate here as to which algorithm of these two gives better results of predicting the fashion retail sales forecasting.
